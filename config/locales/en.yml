# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      some: "The technique of measuring living things. In the latest applications is focused on methods for automatic recognition
                                                    people based on their physical characteristics. An example of a device for measuring biometric which it can be identified
                                                    specific person's iris recognition system recording the image of the iris."

      finger_body_part_one: "Analysis of fingerprints is the oldest of all biometric methods. Even in ancient Babylon and China used a finger stamped as confirmation of a commercial transaction. Over the 1,200 years were discovered not effective methods of identification."
      finger_body_part_two: "Operation of the biometric reader is a very effective. As we know, the DNA of every human being is unique. Not without reason is often called genetic fingerprint. In fact, fingerprint gives 99% confidence during the identification process."
      finger_body_part_three: "Fingerprints finger are scanned by a special sensor, mounted in the security system. Then, his record is converted into a digital code under which verifies a given user. Therefore, no image of the finger (fingerprint) but determined using an algorithm to identify the mathematical equivalent of that image is compared with the matrix."
